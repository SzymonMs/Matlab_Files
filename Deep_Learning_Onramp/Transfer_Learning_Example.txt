Transfer Learning Example Script
The code below implements transfer learning for the flower species example in this chapter. It is available as the script trainflowers.mlx in the course example files. You can download the course example files from the help menu in the top-right corner. You can find more information on this dataset at the 17 Category Flower Dataset page from the University of Oxford.

Note that this example can take some time to run if you run it on a computer that does not have a supported GPU.
Get training images

flower_ds = imageDatastore("Flowers","IncludeSubfolders",true,"LabelSource","foldernames");
[trainImgs,testImgs] = splitEachLabel(flower_ds,0.6);
numClasses = numel(categories(flower_ds.Labels));
 

Create a network by modifying GoogLeNet

deepNetworkDesigner
Replace the fullyConnectedLayer (Convolution and Fully Connected)
Replace the classificationLayer (Output)
 

Set training algorithm options

options = trainingOptions("sgdm","InitialLearnRate", 0.001);
 

Perform training

[flowernet,info] = trainNetwork(trainImgs, lgraph, options);
 

Use trained network to classify test images

testpreds = classify(flowernet,testImgs);
